# Ops-reading-notes

This repo is collection of my reading notes during Code Fellows' Ops and Cybersecurity.

Hello and welcome to my GitHub Reading-Notes repo. In this repo you will find notes from reading assignments taking during ops-201 as well script examples from our code challenges.

I have decided to learn the new skills offered in this course so I can be more versitile and expand my career options after leaving nine years in law enforcment.
During this course I have gained a Greater understanding of computer concepts and their behind the scenes operations. This course has given me the opertunity to study the Ethical hacking Craft and cybersecurity concepts. I learned the foundational skills to continue to move forward and build on my skill sets.

Ive struglled through some of the ops challenges offered, each challenge has offered a learning experience like no other. The projects and lectures have set the foundation with building blocks to build my skills and keep on moving.

There were numerous examples of shell and bash given that are useful in everyday workflow efficiency and convenience. These scripts have helped in building a baseline understanding of scripting and how they can be applied to everyday computing within the workplace.

I would continue to improve upon all of my scripting skills and build upon the knowledge I have gained from these challenges to ensure I understand the fucntions and how to properly use them.

I would like to improve upon my ability to create and understand script freely with minimum use of outside resourses orassistance. Im learning and I love it.
